Biomimetics is based on the belief that nature, at least at times, is a good engineer. Three examples are:

*   spiderwebs
*   beaver dams
*   bee hives

Pick one of the examples above and do some research on its construction. Write a paragraph discussing the strengths and/or weaknesses, and a second paragraph discussing any possible applications for humans of this technology. Feel free to browse the web, bring in figures or draw your own.

Think about and write down your thoughts to the following:

*   Life began in water. Modern land dwelling animals evolved from sea dwelling creatures. The transition from swimming to walking is incredibly important! Use your imagination, knowledge of anatomy, and information on Chapter 2 to write a brief step-by-step set of instructions on how you think this transition happened and what were its consequences on animal structure.
*   Pretend you are making a movie about giant insects taking over Boston. The body of these giant ants is 1,000 times as heavy as the normal weight of ants, but they must look like ants (more or less). How would this size affect the girder of the ant's legs? (Assume that the super ants are made of the same materials as common ants). Important: Chapter 3 mentions proportion. The new body should not have the same proportions as the normal ant. Why? In what ways?

Think about and write down your thoughts to the following: We heard about the utility of using hexagonal shapes in beehives. Choose one of the three options below and discuss whether it would make sense for a company to mass-produce hexagonal "cells" (or a shape derived from them) for constructing:

*   A space station. Since the station floats in space, it will be an interesting discussion as to how to extend the concept to a three-dimensional application. A space station is a place for many humans to live in -- much like a beehive, except humans may be more demanding than bees. Also, the station needs to grow as circumstances require.
*   A dormitory. Dormitories must have rooms, but also corridors, passageways, windows, ventilation, sunlight, a view for most students... A hexagonal shape may be too limiting, but then again, creative minds can think of alternatives.
*   Office cubicles. Under what circumstances is a hexagonal cell advantageous? Think of cells with/without windows, communications, equality in the workplace, etc. Be creative and have fun with the assignment. The purpose is not of course to establish a company, but to discuss the possible extensions and limitations of a successful natural design.

1\. Answer the following questions: Why do monkeys have long arms but short legs? Why are muscles, as percent of weight, about the same in small and large animals, but not bones? Can a structure be constructed where every member is in tension?

2\. Assume that you were able to discover a micro-motor, very similar to the animal's motors described by Vogel. Use your imagination to find uses for such micromotors, used as a single device or many motors bunched together. What are their desirable features? It may be instructive to start with animals' motors.

**Democracy and Genetic Algorithms**  
  
A fierce enemy of democracy, Socrates, the ancient Athenian philopher has formulated a formidable attack on democracy as a system of government. As described by Plato, and loosely translated, Socrates asks:

_"When you get sick do you go around the neighborhood asking for advice?"  
"No”, they answer him, “you go to a special doctor."  
"How about when you must cross a difficult passage by sea, do you go around the market- place asking for advice on how to do it?"  
"No, you go to a good captain who will do the job right."  
"Then," asks Socrates after a few similar questions (with similar answers), "when we need advice about our country, on whose fate our own safety and happiness totally depend, why should go around asking the opinion of every person, however unwise they may be? Shouldn’t we go to specialists in the art of politics and government?"_
