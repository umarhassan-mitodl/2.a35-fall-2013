description: Built to simulate the action of a fish, the RoboTuna was designed by  engineers
  at MIT to see if a robot submarine could mimic the incredibly efficient way tuna
  swim. The metallic tuna proved to use less energy and to be more maneuverable than
  other robotic submarines. Courtesy of Sam Ogden.
